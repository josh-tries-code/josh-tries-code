## 👇 What are those repos below?
Small analytical projects made in my downtime! A great way to learn and grow. <br />

So far, they include:


1. 📊  Immune response to *P. vivax* infection (data from [Hou MM *Nature Communications* 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63104-y)).

|||
|   ---:        |     :---      |         
| `Description`   | Malaria-naive adults undergo one or two *P. vivax* infections, with some reinfected with *P. vivax* or *P. falciaparum*    | 
| `Aim`     | Identify trends in parasitaemia, antibodies, and cytokines across infections    | 

<br />

2. 🧬 Investigating the *P. falciparum* (3D7) reference genome
  
|||
|   ---:        |     :---   |         
| `Description`   | The *Pf*3D7 reference genome remains a ubiquitous resource   | 
| `Aim`     | Determine chromosome size, nucleotide composition, and gene density    | 

<br />

3. 💊 Drug-resistant *P. falciparum* parasites ([Pf8 dataset, MalariaGen](https://www.malariagen.net/data_package/open-dataset-plasmodium-falciparum-v80/))

|||
|   ---:        |     :---   |         
| `Description`   | Pf8 is a large repository of *P. falciparum* genomic data  from parasites isolated people over decades and multiple continents  | 
| `Aim`     | Assess the presence of gene mutations associated with malaria drug resistance, their geographical distritbution and change over time |
